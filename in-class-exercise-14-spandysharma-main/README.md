# SI 579 React template

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## To Run the App
The usual npm commands in the project root:
- `npm install` (which should only need to be done once, after that everything is installed )
- `npm start` will start the server so you can access the site via browser`

## Files to be aware of
There are several files you don't need to be concerned with.

You'll be working in the /src directory almost exclusively.
Leave the `reportWebVitals.js` file alone. Everything else can/should
be changed for the purposes of your app.
